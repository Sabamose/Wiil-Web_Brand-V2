## 🏗️ Architecture Principles

### 1. Feature-Based Organization
- Each feature has its own folder with components, hooks, and types
- Features are self-contained and can be developed independently
- Clear boundaries between features prevent coupling

### 2. Separation of Concerns
- **Core**: Business logic, types, constants
- **Features**: Domain-specific functionality
- **Shared**: Reusable components and utilities
- **Pages**: Route-level components

### 3. Dependency Flow
```
Pages → Features → Shared → Core
```
- Pages can use Features and Shared
- Features can use Shared and Core
- Shared can use Core
- Core has no dependencies

## 🔧 Key Patterns

### Component Organization
```typescript
// Feature component structure
src/features/assistant/
├── components/
│   ├── AssistantCard.tsx
│   ├── AssistantForm.tsx
│   └── AssistantList.tsx
├── hooks/
│   ├── useAssistants.ts
│   └── useAssistantForm.ts
└── index.ts              // Clean exports
```

### Type Safety
- Centralized type definitions in `src/core/types/`
- Interface segregation for better maintainability
- Strict TypeScript configuration

### State Management
- Feature-specific hooks for local state
- Shared hooks for cross-feature state
- Future: Consider Zustand/Redux for complex state

### API Integration
- Service layer pattern (future implementation)
- Consistent error handling
- Type-safe API responses

## 🚀 Benefits for CTOs

### Maintainability
- **Clear Structure**: Easy to navigate and understand
- **Feature Isolation**: Changes in one feature don't affect others
- **Type Safety**: Reduced runtime errors with TypeScript

### Scalability
- **Modular Design**: Add new features without restructuring
- **Team Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on different features
- **Code Reusability**: Shared components reduce duplication

### Performance
- **Tree Shaking**: Unused code is automatically removed
- **Lazy Loading**: Features can be loaded on demand
- **Bundle Optimization**: Clear separation enables better bundling

### Developer Experience
- **Consistent Patterns**: Standardized folder structure and naming
- **Easy Onboarding**: New developers can quickly understand the codebase
- **Tooling Support**: Better IDE support with clear module boundaries

## 📋 Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure ✅
- Set up core types, constants, and utilities
- Create shared UI component exports
- Establish layout components

### Phase 2: Feature Migration (In Progress)
- Migrate assistant-related components
- Migrate conversation-related components
- Create feature-specific hooks

### Phase 3: API Integration (Future)
- Add service layer for API calls
- Implement consistent error handling
- Add loading states and optimistic updates

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Future)
- Add state management (if needed)
- Implement caching strategies
- Add offline support

## 🛠️ Developer Guidelines

### Adding New Features
1. Create feature folder in `src/features/`
2. Add components, hooks, and types
3. Export through `index.ts`
4. Update relevant pages

### Component Development
- Use TypeScript interfaces for props
- Follow naming conventions (PascalCase for components)
- Keep components focused and single-purpose
- Use shared UI components when possible

### State Management
- Start with local state (useState, useReducer)
- Move to feature hooks when state is shared
- Consider global state only when necessary

### Testing Strategy (Future)
- Unit tests for core utilities
- Component tests for UI components
- Integration tests for features
- E2E tests for critical user flows

## 📈 Metrics & Monitoring

### Code Quality
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- ESLint configuration for consistency
- Prettier for code formatting

### Performance Tracking
- Bundle size monitoring
- Core Web Vitals tracking
- Feature usage analytics

This architecture ensures the codebase remains maintainable, scalable, and developer-friendly as the project grows.
